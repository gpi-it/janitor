                    <strong>SEARCH / NEW: </strong><br>
                    Search for farms/markets/points of sale in our database. Add a new entry, if no entry exists.<br>
                    This is useful for checking directly on the market, if the farmers present are already in our database.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>COMPLETE DATA: </strong><br>
                    You get a random entry from our database. The data can be completed by talking to the owner, looking at the website or googling.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Tipp:</strong> For completing the data it is recommended to have the cleaning page very small next to the webpage of the foodpoint.</p>
